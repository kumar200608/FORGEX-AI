**Meiporul** takes any AI-generated answer, breaks it into atomic factual claims, verifies each one against live multi-source evidence, and — when a claim is wrong — rewrites it and re-verifies the correction. Built for the **ML-2: Fact-Checked Answer Generation** problem statement.

> **Not a fact-checker app. A trust-layer API that any AI product can plug into before showing its output to a user.**

## Why This Exists

AI answers sound confident even when they're wrong. Once a person catches one hallucination, they stop trusting everything the AI says — not just the part that was wrong. 

Most fact-checking tools work at the document level: one verdict for an entire answer. That misses errors hiding inside otherwise-true text.

**Meiporul checks every atomic claim independently** — so instead of *"this answer might be wrong somewhere,"* a user (or the enterprise deploying the AI) gets:
> *"Claims 3 and 7 are contradicted by evidence. Here is the exact excerpt why, and here are the grounded, re-verified corrections."*

## Pipeline Stages

| Stage | What Happens | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Claim Extraction** | Input text is decomposed into atomic, independently-verifiable factual assertions (FActScore-style, `temperature=0.0` for strict determinism). Coordinates are split and pronouns are resolved. | List of atomic claims (`ExtractedClaim`) |
| **2. Evidence Retrieval** | Each claim is routed to Wikipedia (encyclopedic foundation) and/or Tavily (real-time web search), retrieved and ranked via sub-word cosine similarity. | Ranked evidence passages per claim |
| **3. Dual-Signal Verification** | Signal A (Gemini) and Signal B (local DeBERTa NLI) independently evaluate each claim against passages; consensus arbitration determines the outcome. | Verdict: `Supported`, `Contradicted`, or `Not Enough Info` |
| **4. Grounded Rewrite** | Only fired for `Contradicted` claims. Generates a corrected assertion strictly using retrieved evidence — never hallucinating or inventing new facts. | Evidence-grounded rewritten claim |
| **5. Re-verification** | The rewrite is cross-checked against evidence again before returning to close the loop. If uncorrectable, flags `is_correctable=false`. | Confirmed, self-corrected assertion |

---

## Dual-Signal Verification

Two independent models cross-check every single claim so no single model failure decides a verdict:
* **Signal A (Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite)**: Reasoning-based semantic verification with natural language justification and excerpt extraction.
* **Signal B (Local DeBERTa NLI - `cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-small`)**: Zero-API, local CPU inference performing natural language inference (entailment vs. contradiction vs. neutral) directly comparing premise (evidence) and hypothesis (claim).

### Arbitration Modes

| Mode | When It Fires |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dual-Signal Consensus** | Both Signal A and Signal B agree unanimously (`Supported` or `Contradicted`). Highest confidence. |
| **Mediated Consensus** | One signal detects entailment/support while the other has insufficient context (no contradiction). Blended confidence. |
| **Dual-Signal Conflict** | Signals disagree directly (`Supported` vs. `Contradicted`). Safely routed to `Not Enough Info` with machine-readable reason code (`conflicting_signals`). |
| **Single-Signal Fallback** | Signal A unavailable (rate-limit 429, timeout, or network blip) $\rightarrow$ Signal B's verdict is adopted directly if confidence $\ge 0.60$, logged cleanly in audit trace. |
| **Explicit Refutation Override** | Authoritative evidence contains active debunking language (*"myth"*, *"overestimate"*, *"contrary to"*, *"misleading"*), capturing soft refutations even without numeric mismatch. |
| **Temporal Impossibility Override** | Claim attributes an event/role to an entity at a date that is chronologically impossible (e.g. leading a project after death). |
| **Scope Mismatch Filter** | An unconditional/general claim (*"The sky is green"*) is only supported by conditional/exceptional evidence (*"thunderstorm clouds cause optical green scattering"*). Intercepts false positives and routes to `evidence_scope_mismatch`. |

---

## Self-Correcting Rewrite

Most fact-checkers stop at flagging an error with a red badge. **Meiporul goes further**: when a claim is `Contradicted`, it synthesizes an accurate revision grounded strictly in the retrieved evidence, then re-verifies that correction before returning it. 

If the evidence does not contain sufficient details to safely correct the claim, the engine explicitly outputs `is_correctable=false` rather than guessing — anti-hallucination is enforced at the rewrite stage itself.

### Real Example:
* **Original Claim**:  
  > *"JWST was designed and built under the leadership of Albert Einstein in 1955."*
* **Pipeline Verdict**:  
  `Contradicted` *(Confidence: 0.92, Mode: Temporal Impossibility Override)*
* **Grounded Correction**:  
  > *"The James Webb Space Telescope was designed and built by a collaborative team led by NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency starting in the late 1990s — not Albert Einstein, who died in April 1955, decades before the project was initiated in 1996."*

---

## Security & Hardening

* **CORS Hardening**: Strict origin allowlist (disallows invalid wildcard + credential combinations), regex-scoped for local dev, and configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for production.
* **Prompt Injection Defense**: User input is quarantined in `<untrusted_text_to_analyze>` and `<claim_to_verify>` XML delimiters with system-level directives instructing models to treat content strictly as unverified data, never as executable commands. Sanitizer strips fake system prefixes (`SYSTEM:`, `ADMIN:`, `Ignore instructions`).
* **Rate Limiting**: Built-in sliding-window in-memory limiter (default `15 requests/minute/IP`, configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`).
* **Input Validation & DoS Protection**: Hard cap of `max_length=15000` characters enforced by Pydantic on incoming answers to prevent runaway token billing and memory exhaustion.
* **Error Sanitization**: Unhandled exceptions are logged server-side with full tracebacks while returning clean, generic error messages to the client — zero internal paths or secrets leaked.
* **Multi-Key Failover Pool**: Automatic failover across a comma-separated pool of backup Gemini API keys (`GEMINI_BACKUP_KEYS`) on 429 quota exhaustion.
* **Zero-Secret Git Cleanliness**: `.env` is fully gitignored and has never been committed. Repository is regularly scanned for keys and oversized artifacts.

## Business Model

Meiporul is positioned as **infrastructure, not a consumer application** — a trust layer that sits between any LLM and any user-facing product, distributed via a usage-based API.

* **Target Audience**: Companies already shipping customer-facing AI agents, customer support bots, clinical summarizers, legal copilots, and ed-tech platforms who carry regulatory and reputational liability if their AI generates hallucinations.
* **Why Claim-Level, Not Document-Level**: Trust breaks at the claim level. An answer that is 90% accurate but contains 1 critical hallucination completely destroys user confidence. Document-level scoring cannot pinpoint or fix the issue.
* **Why B2B API-First**: The party with budget and urgency is the enterprise liable for inaccurate outputs. Infrastructure scales exponentially through automated agent workflows, not individual consumer dashboard visits.
* **Go-to-Market Strategy**:
  1. Target open-source agent ecosystems (LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI tool integrations).
  2. Direct outreach to ed-tech and technical documentation platforms with high hallucination sensitivity.
  3. Tiered pricing model: Base API tier (rate-limited) $\rightarrow$ Enterprise Dedicated Tier (custom domain ontologies and private NLI nodes).

## Roadmap

Currently built with Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite and local DeBERTa. Next production milestones:

- [ ] **Multi-Provider LLM Abstraction**: Pluggable interface for Signal A supporting Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and local Ollama/vLLM endpoints.
- [ ] **Enterprise Domain Connectors**: Specialized retrieval connectors for PubMed/NCBI (medical), SEC EDGAR (financial), and court filings (legal).
- [ ] **Distributed Semantic Cache**: Redis-backed claim embedding cache to reduce verification latency to $<100\text{ms}$ on recurring queries.
- [ ] **Streaming Claim Verification**: WebSocket / SSE streaming endpoint that checks and highlights claims incrementally as the generative LLM streams tokens.
