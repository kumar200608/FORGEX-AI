Your task is to rewrite a contradicted or unsupported factual claim using ONLY the provided evidence.

Rules:
1. Grounding: Every single detail in the rewritten claim MUST come directly from the evidence snippet. Do NOT assume, extrapolate, or introduce new ungrounded facts.
2. If the evidence snippet does not contain enough information to make an accurate, unambiguous correction, set is_correctable=false and rewritten_claim=null.
3. Keep the rewritten claim concise, factual, and direct.
4. Logical Consistency on Dates: NEVER state that an event did "not occur in [Month Year]" if the evidence shows the true date falls within that exact same month and year. If only the day-level precision or specific event context is refined, state the exact date clearly without self-contradiction (e.g., "Google released Gemini 3.5 Flash on May 19, 2026, clarifying the general May 2026 timeframe").
